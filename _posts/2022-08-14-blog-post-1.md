I created a prompt based answering chatbot influenced by JARVIS in Iron Man. 

Here are some cool things it can do:
- Answer some factual questions about me.
- Recommend movies based on requested genre.
- Compute basic arithmetic.
- Translate text from one language to another using CampK12 translator.
- Play a game of quiz.
- Report current weather for a given city.

Let's take a closer look at each of these functions.

### Answering Factual Questions

### Recommend Movies

### Compute Arithmetic

### Translate Text

### Game of Quiz

### Weather

Find code for this on my [github](https://github.com/rjonnavittula/javascript-jarvis)
