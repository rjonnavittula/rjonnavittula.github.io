I created a prompt based answering chatbot influenced by JARVIS in Iron Man. 

Here are some cool things it can do:

1. Answer some factual questions about me.
2. Recommend movies based on requested genre.
3. Compute basic arithmetic.
4. Translate text from one language to another using CampK12 translator.
5. Play a game of quiz.
6. Report current weather for a given city.


Let's take a closer look at each of these functions.

### Answering Factual Questions

### Recommend Movies

### Compute Arithmetic
